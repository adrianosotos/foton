# Getting Started

This is a Foton Tech frontend challenge which uses Google Books API and React to build a mobile book app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

OBS.: To show currently reading book on home page you have to click on 'Read' on a book page.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
